# House_price_estimation_with_deep_learning
### project_notebook.ipynb

In this project, we first read the data and perform the necessary pre-processing with the information we have about the data characteristics. Then we build a simple deep learning model with the relu activation parameter.
We compiled our model with adam optimizer and mean_squared_error loss and finally we fit the model on the data with 200 epochs, and the model loss diagram is as follows.
